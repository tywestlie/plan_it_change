# Plan It Change 10 Back End API Readme

## Summary

  This readme was written for the Plan It Change back end API developed to support the [front end](https://github.com/abomb14c/PlanItChange-10) produced by Alan Charles. It lays out how the API functions and the different end points used to obtain information from the back end. There are a four different models that are utilized by this back end.

## Models

  *- Note: all models also include a created at and updated at datetime entry.*

### User Model

### Event Model

  The event model is made up of an event's city, state, information about that event, a start time,end time, owner, and event name.

### Post Model

  The post model is made up of a posts body.

### Comment Model

  The comment model is made up of a comments body.

## Routes

*-Note: most of these routes are restricted to only listen to the front end for requests*

  The back end API for Plan It Change 10 is RESTful, therefore it includes index, show, update, create and destroy end points depending on the level of authorization of the user. Once a user has registered for an account, the front-end will request a JSON web token through the request route, and this will give it the authorization needed to reach the different routes that require authorization.
